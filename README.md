# Media_Server_RaspberryPI4
its a IOT based academic project (Advanced Operating System)
The idea is to create a media server so that devices on the same network can play movies, music 
and other type of media from a central location. Goal is very simple, which is to create a fast 
and ready to stream across home network easily. This reduces any hassle of loading of media 
files in every device. With the help of a media server all the family members can enjoy their 
personal favorite shows at the same time while using a home server of their own.
